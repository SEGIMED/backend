## Good practices

 * The comments, documentation and code must be in ENGLISH
 * Use the relevant validations in the models, in order to detect errors early and avoid failed queries to the database.
 * Create unit tests for the routes to be created, because of the asociations between the models 
 * If a task is left incomplete then leave a TODO comment to specify what is missing and also leave a record in the trello.
